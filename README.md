EcoAirMap: A Smart Platform for Targeted Tree Planting to Improve Air Quality

Problem Statement: Rapid urbanization and deforestation have led to declining oxygen levels and rising pollution in urban areas, severely impacting public health and the environment. Identifying and locating high-pollution, low-oxygen zones is critical to solve these issues effectively.

Proposed Solution: EcoAirMap is a smart platform that uses geospatial analysis, real-time air quality data, and AI to identify critical zones with low oxygen and high pollution levels. It recommends specific locations for tree planting and suggests the most effective tree species based on local pollutants, soil quality, and climate.

Key Features:

1. Interactive Heatmap: Visualizes high-pollution zones and optimal planting areas.


2. Tree Recommendations: Suggests species best suited to absorb pollutants and increase oxygen levels.


3. Plantation Tracking: Tracks planted trees using GPS, monitors growth, and calculates environmental impact.


4. Community Involvement: Engages individuals, NGOs, and governments in collaborative plantation drives.


5. Predictive Analytics: Uses AI to predict future pollution hotspots and optimize plantation strategies.

Impact: By targeting specific areas for plantation and ensuring the survival of planted trees, EcoAirMap can significantly improve urban air quality, increase oxygen levels, and reduce pollutants like CO2, PM2.5, and NOx.

Technologies: Full stack app, GIS mapping, AI/ML for predictions, and APIs for real-time air quality and climate data.

Conclusion: EcoAirMap is an innovative, data-driven approach to combating air pollution and enhancing urban life and ecosystems, offering scalable and sustainable solutions to environmental challenges.
